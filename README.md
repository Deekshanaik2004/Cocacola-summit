##   Prompt used 
Create a high-resolution photorealistic CGI scene of a single Prime energy-drink can (product image is attached) perched on the jagged summit of a rugged mountain under a dramatic night sky filled with stars and a bright moon. The can is opened and tilted forward, sending a glowing torrent of the drink cascading down the mountainside like a luminous waterfall, with realistic liquid dynamics, spray, and mist catching the moonlight. Use a slightly elevated front-view camera angle (~ 50 mm lens equivalent) to emphasize both the height of the peak and the downward flow. Light the scene with cool moonlight and subtle rim-lighting on the can to create cinematic contrast, while highlighting metallic reflections and sparkling droplets in the falling liquid. Maintain an epic, energetic mood that conveys power and refreshment. Aspect ratio: 4: 5. Output at 3200 × 4000 px PNG.
